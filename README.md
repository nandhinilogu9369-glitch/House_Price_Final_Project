# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project

## 📌 Problem Statement
House prices are influenced by multiple factors such as size, location, and quality.  
The goal of this project is to **predict house prices** using data and machine learning.

## 🔧 Approach
- Collected and cleaned housing dataset
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Performed feature engineering and data visualization
- Built a regression model to predict prices
- Evaluated performance using R² score and RMSE

## 📊 Key Insights
- Living area and number of rooms strongly impact house price
- Location/Neighborhood has a significant effect
- Quality of materials also plays a major role

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Outcome
- Final model predicts house prices with ~85% accuracy
- Provides insights useful for buyers and sellers
